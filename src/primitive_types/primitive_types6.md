# Exercise 22

- Name: ```primitive_types6```
- Path: ```exercises/primitive_types/primitive_types6.rs```
#### Hint: 

While you could use a destructuring `let` for the tuple here, try
indexing into it instead, as explained in the last example of the
Data Types -> The Tuple Type section of the book:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type
Now you have another tool in your toolbox!
