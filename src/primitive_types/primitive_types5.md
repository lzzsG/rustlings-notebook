# Exercise 21

- Name: ```primitive_types5```
- Path: ```exercises/primitive_types/primitive_types5.rs```
#### Hint: 

Take a look at the Data Types -> The Tuple Type section of the book:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type
Particularly the part about destructuring (second to last example in the section).
You'll need to make a pattern to bind `name` and `age` to the appropriate parts
of the tuple. You can do it!!
