# Exercise 20

- Name: ```primitive_types4```
- Path: ```exercises/primitive_types/primitive_types4.rs```
#### Hint: 

Take a look at the Understanding Ownership -> Slices -> Other Slices section of the book:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-03-slices.html
and use the starting and ending indices of the items in the Array
that you want to end up in the slice.

If you're curious why the first argument of `assert_eq!` does not
have an ampersand for a reference since the second argument is a
reference, take a look at the coercion chapter of the nomicon:
