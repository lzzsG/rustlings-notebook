# Exercise 38

- Name: ```strings2```
- Path: ```exercises/strings/strings2.rs```
#### Hint: 

Yes, it would be really easy to fix this by just changing the value bound to `word` to be a
string slice instead of a `String`, wouldn't it?? There is a way to add one character to line
12, though, that will coerce the `String` into a string slice.

Side note: If you're interested in learning about how this kind of reference conversion works, you can jump ahead in the book and read this part in the smart pointers chapter: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch15-02-deref.html#implicit-deref-coercions-with-functions-and-methods
