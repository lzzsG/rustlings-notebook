# Exercise 72

- Name: ```iterators1```
- Path: ```exercises/iterators/iterators1.rs```
#### Hint: 

Step 1:
We need to apply something to the collection `my_fav_fruits` before we start to go through
it. What could that be? Take a look at the struct definition for a vector for inspiration:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html
Step 2 & step 3:
Very similar to the lines above and below. You've got this!
Step 4:
An iterator goes through all elements in a collection, but what if we've run out of
elements? What should we expect here? If you're stuck, take a look at
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html for some ideas.
