# Exercise 76

- Name: ```iterators5```
- Path: ```exercises/iterators/iterators5.rs```
#### Hint: 

The documentation for the std::iter::Iterator trait contains numerous methods
that would be helpful here.

The collection variable in count_collection_iterator is a slice of HashMaps. It
needs to be converted into an iterator in order to use the iterator methods.

The fold method can be useful in the count_collection_iterator function.

For a further challenge, consult the documentation for Iterator to find
a different method that could make your code more compact than using fold.
