# Exercise 23

- Name: ```vecs1```
- Path: ```exercises/vecs/vecs1.rs```
#### Hint: 

In Rust, there are two ways to define a Vector.
1. One way is to use the `Vec::new()` function to create a new vector
  and fill it with the `push()` method.
2. The second way, which is simpler is to use the `vec![]` macro and
  define your elements inside the square brackets.
