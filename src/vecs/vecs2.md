# Exercise 24

- Name: ```vecs2```
- Path: ```exercises/vecs/vecs2.rs```
#### Hint: 

Hint 1: In the code, the variable `element` represents an item from the Vec as it is being iterated.
Can you try multiplying this?

Hint 2: For the first function, there's a way to directly access the numbers stored
in the Vec, using the * dereference operator. You can both access and write to the
number that way.

After you've completed both functions, decide for yourself which approach you like
better. What do you think is the more commonly used pattern under Rust developers?

```rust,editable
// vecs2.rs
//
// A Vec of even numbers is given. Your task is to complete the loop so that
// each number in the Vec is multiplied by 2.
//
// Make me pass the test!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint vecs2` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.

// I AM NOT DONE

fn vec_loop(mut v: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    for element in v.iter_mut() {
        // TODO: Fill this up so that each element in the Vec `v` is
        // multiplied by 2.
        ???
    }

    // At this point, `v` should be equal to [4, 8, 12, 16, 20].
    v
}

fn vec_map(v: &Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    v.iter().map(|element| {
        // TODO: Do the same thing as above - but instead of mutating the
        // Vec, you can just return the new number!
        ???
    }).collect()
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_vec_loop() {
        let v: Vec<i32> = (1..).filter(|x| x % 2 == 0).take(5).collect();
        let ans = vec_loop(v.clone());

        assert_eq!(ans, v.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<i32>>());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_vec_map() {
        let v: Vec<i32> = (1..).filter(|x| x % 2 == 0).take(5).collect();
        let ans = vec_map(&v);

        assert_eq!(ans, v.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<i32>>());
    }
