# Exercise 85

- Name: ```macros2```
- Path: ```exercises/macros/macros2.rs```
#### Hint: 

Macros don't quite play by the same rules as the rest of Rust, in terms of
what's available where.

Unlike other things in Rust, the order of "where you define a macro" versus
"where you use it" actually matters.
